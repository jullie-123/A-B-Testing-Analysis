# A-B-Testing-Analysis

## Overview
A large company with a substantial user base plans to increase sales through advertisements on its website. However, they are uncertain whether these ads are effective in boosting sales. To address this, an A/B testing experiment was conducted over 31 days, involving 20,000 customers.

The goal of this project is to analyze the A/B test results and determine if the advertisements lead to a statistically significant increase in sales.
## Data cleaning and preprocessing
In the initial data preprosseing we perform the following tasks:

- Data loading and inspection.
- Handling missing values.
- Data cleaning and formatting
- Ensure data types and values are appropriate for analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involves Understand the distribution of ad views and purchases.
Compare behaviors between control and test groups.
A/B Testing:
Define null and alternative hypotheses:
Null Hypothesis: Ads have no effect on purchases.
Alternative Hypothesis: Ads increase the likelihood of purchases.

Perform statistical tests (e.g., t-tests or chi-square tests) to evaluate the results.

## Technologies used

- Python: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Pandas:For handling and cleaning data.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.
- Scipy and statsmodels: Statistical Analysis
